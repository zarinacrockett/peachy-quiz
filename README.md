JoJo's peach is a simple quiz that keeps score.


JOJO'S BIZZARE TRIVIA

This is a trivia game that is based on the anime serries JOjo's Bizare Adventure


Motivation

I was motivated to build this app because I am a fan of JoJo's Bizare Adventure and thought this would be a good way to teach people more about it.

Build Status.

The game it'self works well! I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a start page, gamiing page and score page.

Currently the the saving aspect of the score page is bugged. I working on recording names and scores.


Pics pf the actual game.
