JoJo's peach is a simple quiz that keeps score.


JOJO'S BIZZARE TRIVIA

This is a trivia game that is based on the anime serries JOjo's Bizare Adventure


Motivation

I was motivated to build this app because I am a fan of JoJo's Bizare Adventure and thought this would be a good way to teach people more about it.

Build Status.

The game it'self works well! I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a start page, gaming page and score page.

Currently the the saving aspect of the score page is bugged. I working on recording names and scores.

I used divs and class to make all the buttons and asigned event listeners to click and record the scores. The questions are in an array that uses math.random and a function of new questions to grab new questions make the game slightly different each time.


how to use?

player clicks start button to run the game and the player I wll be given a question with four choices.
